Do not allow user to remove / characters from date
Users should be able to edit historic transactions
History should allow user to filter by exact dates
more advanced filters on history page
i.e. category, 'sort by asc/desc', etc, etc.
pagination on history page? could eventually contain HUNDREDS to THOUSANDS of items here
Import/Export functionality
  since all data is stored locally, clearing cache/cookies could erase everything!
  that would be BAD
Add bar chart to show spent vs limit for range if month is selected
